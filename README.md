# ContactManagementSystem
The contact management system is a simple self-developed project, implementing .NET REST API with appropriate data storage solution using EFCore.  

Setting up and running Sample Applications to run the ContactManagementSystem Solution with the .NET Core, you need the respective Visual Studio 2019 or 2017 and .NET Core versions installed on your machine. 

To set up SQL connection string and tables, please run dataBaseScript on [database]. UPDATE connection string, [ContactDbConnection] 

I also recommend downloading and installing the free version of the Postman as your service client tool. After opening and building the solution with Visual Studio, you can select one of the available browsers from the IIS Express button dropdown on the menu bar, and then click that button to start the application. 

Also, you can run below command to run API after download: 

$ Cd CMS.Elements.Api.Web.Host $ dotnet run
